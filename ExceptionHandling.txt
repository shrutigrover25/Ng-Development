it is most difficult error to be traced as it is the error on the logical part of the coding or the Logicalerror 
is a bug in a program that causes it operate incorrectly. 

Runtime Error:

Try catch method :

JS uses the try catch method to handle the exceptions and it also uses the throw operator to hsndle the exception.
try have the main code to run and in the catch block if any error is thrown by try block will be caught and catch
will execute it. 
Finally block always occur even if an error is thrown. 

try{
    [break;]
}

catch(exception e){
    [break;]
}

Finally : 
try{
    [break;]
}

catch(exception e){
    [break;]
}

Finally;
