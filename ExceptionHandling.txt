   window.printme();

   // A runtime error 
</script>

Logical error :

it is most difficult error to be traced as it is the error on the logical part of the coding or the Logicalerror 
is a bug in a program that causes it operate incorrectly. 

Runtime Error:
it occurs during the running of the program also known as exception


Try catch method :

JS uses the try catch method to handle the exceptions and it also uses the throw operator to hsndle the exception.
try have the main code to run and in the catch block if any error is thrown by try block will be caught and catch
will execute it. 
Finally block always occur even if an error is thrown. 

try{
    [break;]
}

catch(exception e){
    [break;]
}

Finally : 
try{
    [break;]

// FORM VALIDATION 


It is the way to ensure that the data users enter into a form is correct before it gets submitted. 
This help ensures that the things like email,password, and other important details are enteredproperly, making
the user experience smoother and data accurate. 

Steps for Form Validations :

1. Data Retrieval :the first step is used to get the user's value enetered into the form fields. 
this is done using documents.forms,RegForm 

2. Data Validation :

a. Name Validation : we check to make sure that the name field is not empty and does not contain any numbers. 
b. Address Validation : this field is not empty. 
c/ Email Validation: email field is not empty and that includes @ symbol. 
d. password validation : password field is not emptyand password is atleast 6 characters long. 
e. Course selection : Course has been selected from the drop down list. 


3. Error Handling : if any of the checks fail, an alert message is used to shown to the user  telling 
windows.alert, telling them what's wrong. 

4. Submission Controls : if validation checks pass, functions will return true --> meaning form can be submitted. 
if not, it will return false, stopping the form to get submitted . 

5. Focus Alignment :
