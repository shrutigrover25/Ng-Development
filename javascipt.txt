JavaScript Loops 

Repetitions made easy 


1. for Loops
2. do while 
3. while loop 
4. for in loop 
5. for of loop 



While Loop --> exceutes a block of statement as long as the specific condition is true. 


while(condition){
    // code to be executed
}


Do While Loop --> block of code inside the loop will be exceuted atleast once

do {

} while(condition)


While Loop         do While loop 


while loop --> 1. it is the entry condition looping structure 
2. number of iterations depends on the condition mentioned in the while loop 
3. the block control condition is available at the starting of the code 


Do While Loop 
1. It is an exit condition structure 
2. There will be min imum of 1 iteration 
3. The block control condition is available at the endpoint of the loop 


FOR LOOPS :
It is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on the condition. 
3 parts 

1. initialization 
2. condition 
3. Increment/decrement 



for(statement-1; statement-2, statement-3){
// code 
}


let x;

for(let x=2;x<=4;x++){
    console.log(x);
}


FOR IN LOOP --> iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, allows us to access each key or property name in turn. 

traverse object properties. 

It can be used iwth arrays 

Synatx:

for(let i in obj1){
    // print all they keys 

    console.log(i);
}


Some important points :

1. over non-array objects 
2. The order in which properties are iterated may not match thr properties that are defined in the object. 




FOR OF LOOP -->

It iterates over the values of an iterable object, which id different from the for..in loop. 

for(variable of iterable){
    // block to be exceuted
}


Parameters :

1. Variable  --> Represents the current value of each iteration
2. Iterable --> Any Object that can be iterated over 


TERNARY OPERATOR

It is the shortcut for writing if-else conditions 
Known as the conditional operator because it works on the condition onlt. 

allows you to decide between two values depending on whether a condition is true or false. 


condition : A statement that returns true or false 

value : if true : 
if false:

condition ? trueExpression :falseExpression 


1. Create a nested ternary Operator Function to check for the age :
adult, teenager, senior citizen


JavaScript Objects :

1. Arrays 
2. Strings 
3. Date 
4. Numbers 
5. Math 
6. Object 
7. Boolean 
8. JSON
9. MAP 
10. set


1. Arrays :

That is used to store multiple values in a single variable. 
It can hold various Data types and allows for dynamic resizing 

Elements are accessed by their index, starts from 0


How to create an array in JavaScriptt


const arrayName=[value1, value2,....];

Using new Keyword

let arrayName=new Array();


Basic Operations in an array :

1. accessing the element in the array 
Using the Index 

2. accessing the first element

3. aceessing the last element

4. Modifying the array elements

5. Adding elements to an array 

6. Removing elements from an array 

7. Array Length 

8. Increase and decrease of the array Length

9. Iterating through the array elements

10. Array Concatenation 

11. Conversion of an array to a string 

12. CHeck the type of an array 


Difference between an object and an array :

1. arrays :

numeric indexes 
ordered  ollection 
sorting, lists, 

accessed by index 
iterated with loops 
dynamic 

2. Objects 

named keys (strings or symbols)
unordered  ollection 
storing data in form of key-value pair 

accessed by key 
iterated using object.keys
dynamic


DATE OBJECT 

1/ creating a date Object 

new Date();
new Date(value);
new Date(dateString)
new Date(years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds);


// Write a code that will convert the date into a slash format and also it shoud print the date 12 days ahead of the current date


MATH OBJECT 

USED TO PERFORM THE MATHEMATICALMOPERATIONS ON NUMBERS 
ALL THE PROPERTIES OF MATHS ARE STATIC AND UNLIKE OTHER OBJECTS, IT DOES NOT HAVE A CONSTRUCTOR 


STRINGS IN JAVASCRIPT 

1. DEclaration of string 

let str="Hello World"

let str='Hello'

let str=new String("Hello World);

let str=''

str.Length


1. declare 3 strings with three different formats, and you have to find out the length of each string
